The goal here is to showcase the usage of dataman, ideally we'd have each example
implemented using a couple different databases as well as dataman-- to show the difference.

In addition we should have "versions" of the app to showcase schema migration


Some use cases:
    - k/v store
    - document store
    - time-series
