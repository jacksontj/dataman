decide what the failure here should look like. It should either be:

    1. Return "projected" result (which has nothing in it)
    2. Error
    
Either way will have potentially huge perf gains by checking the validity of the projection first.
The main thing to keep in mind is that some subfields we don't know about (as we might have a subset of document schema -- for example)
