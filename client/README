# Dataman Client
This package contains the client for dataman. 

The client is modeled loosely after the golang http client, specifically that 
there is a client and a transport layer. This allows us to have consistent 
metrics/configs/etc with a single unified client, but allow us flexibility in
how we connect to dataman through the transport layer.


# Examples
There is a sub-package of "example_usage" with good examples of how to use 
these clients in golang.
